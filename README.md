# Outlast 2 Recording Converter
 
To use this just put the recording file you want to convert into the same folder as the batch file titled "RunFile.bat" then run it. Enter the name of the recording into the batch file, and it will convert it all for you. Precompiled recordings are not supported, only ones recorded in game with the camcorder are supported. Also audio doesn't get exported either.
